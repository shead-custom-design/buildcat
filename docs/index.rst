Welcome!
========

Buildcat is a portable, lightweight, elegant render farm based on `RQ
<http://python-rq.org>`_ and `Redis <https://redis.io>`_.  It runs on OSX,
Linux, and Windows, includes integration with `SideFX Houdini <http://sidefx.com>`_,
and can be easily extended to support other tools.
