Anaconda Installation
=====================

Whether you’re new to Python or an old hand, we highly recommend installing
`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_. Anaconda includes and
conveniently installs Python and other commonly used packages for scientific
computing and data science, including many of Buildcat's dependencies.
