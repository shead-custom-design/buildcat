Compatibility
=============

A quick disclaimer on backwards-compatibility for Buildcat users:

Buildcat follows the `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_ standard for
assigning version numbers in a way that has specific meaning.  As of this
writing Buildcat releases are still in the `0.y.z` development phase, which
means (among other things) that the API may change at any time.  We try not to
be abusive about it, but you should be prepared for the occasional bump on the
road to the 1.0 release.
